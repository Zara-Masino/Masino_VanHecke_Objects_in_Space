Idea
To see how many objects you’ve passed
Keep iterating through for loop of group of objects 
If the cameras x y or z position is greater than a specific objects x y or z position in the array then increment the number of boxes you’ve passed. Otherwise decrement 
After the number of objects you have passed reached a certain number, move yourself to the thr very starting position.
